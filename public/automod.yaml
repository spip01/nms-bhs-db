    Thank You for posting your {{match-flair_text}} to /r/{{subreddit}}. Your post has been set for moderator review. Please be patient until a (human) moderator has a chance to review this post. This post was automatically flagged because it appears you used the word "black" to describe this starship.

    * If you only used the word "black" to describe smaller trim pieces, there is a good chance your post **WILL** be approved.

    * However, if you  used the word "black" to describe the overall color of this starship, there is a good chance this post **WILL NOT** be approved. Especially if your photo has poor lighting...

    See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NMSCoordinateExchange/comments/d0ljoz/psa_black_ships_aside_from_freighters_do_not/) for more information.

    Thank You for posting your {{match-flair_text}} to /r/{{subreddit}}. Your post has been removed because we're trying to keep confusing and misleading information given to new users to a minimum. Thank you for helping us with this.

    * The class of a ship and its exact slot count are only valid for a *crashed* ship. For any other ship location, ship class and slot count is entirely *random* and should NOT be included.
    * Freighter class and slot counts are also *random* based on spawning so should also NOT be included.

    **Please**, repost your {{match-flair_text}} keeping this in mind. 

    For a more detailed explanation please read this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NMSCoordinateExchange/comments/g6kb2j/psa_basic_recommendations_to_avoid_confusion_when/)

    * Ships are common across **ALL** PLATFORMS (PS4/PC/XB1) **AND** GAME MODES (Normal/Survival/Permadeath/Creative) so this information should **NOT** be mentioned.
    
    **Please**, repost your {{match-flair_text}}  WITHOUT mention of your PLATFORM **AND** GAME MODE.

We are trying to keep confusing and misleading information given to new users to a minimum. Thank you for your help with this.

    * Ships are found across the entire system so please **DO NOT** include "trade post" or "space station" in your description unless it's a first wave at a space station. First wave is only valid at a space station and is the first group of ships, usually 4, to land **AFTER** a reload or reset. Later waves should not be mentioned.

    **How to find Freighters using member submitted coordinates:** 

    **System Freighters** (15-19 inventory slots) can be found by traveling via portal using the coordinates provided in this post. Once you are in the right system, pulse around in space until the correct system freighter spawns.

    **Capital Freighters** (24-34 inventory slots) are slightly more complex to find using member submitted coordinates. See [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/NMSCoordinateExchange/comments/j5grbr/finding_capital_freighters_with_coordinates_is/) for more information.

    **Tips for finding Multi-tools from shared coordinates**

    User error is the most common reason players have difficulty finding Multi-tools from shared coordinates. If you are having troubles locating this MT, please read the tips below! 

    * Turn off multiplayer before going through the portal 
    * Ensure you are in the correct galaxy 
    * Double check that you entered the glyph sequence correctly 
    * Make sure you follow the OP’s instructions exactly 
    * Not every MT is located at the space station 
    * Some MT’s required you to save and reload on a specific planet/moon (or the space station) and then travel to a specific location to acquire the MT

    **NMS is NOT a “traditional” cross-play game in some aspects**

    * **IMPORTANT NOTE**: Outside of multiplayer, you will not see this {{match-flair_text}} UNLESS you are on the same PLATFORM / GAME MODE (and in the same galaxy) as advertised in the flair of this post. 

    * Inside of multiplayer, at least one player **MUST** be from the PLATFORM / GAME MODE advertised in the flair of this post for all players in your group to see this {{match-flair_text}}.

    Your post has been marked for moderator review due to the recent rise in the misuse of the "{{match}}" post flair. Please make sure there is not a more appropriate flair available for your post. Flair use is outlined on our [wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/NMSCoordinateExchange/wiki/flair). Post for "{{match}}" flair must still follow all the sub rules for approval by the moderators.
